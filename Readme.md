🎵 Music Streaming App - Backend
This is a full-featured Music Streaming API built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It supports core music app functionality like:

🎤 Artist uploads

🎧 Song streaming

💽 Album and playlist management

❤️ Like system

🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Role-based user system (artist or listener)

The goal is to simulate the backend architecture of a modern music platform (like Spotify or SoundCloud) with clean RESTful API design and extensible database schemas.
